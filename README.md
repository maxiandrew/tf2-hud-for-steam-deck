# About

This is **TF2 HUD for Steam Deck**, an optimised HUD for your Steam Deck that gives you bigger HUD elements for your little screen!

You can choose your playstyle like *Decked Mode* and *Docked Mode* to adapt the size of the HUD.

> [!NOTE]
> This HUD has been made early access because whilst the main elements of the HUD have been optimised, most of the remaining HUD elements have yet to be optimised. There might also be bugs present when using the HUD.
>
> If you would like to contribute to further improve the user experience on Steam Deck and eventually get it finished for full release, you'll be credited for your work.
# Installation

Once downloaded, go into the ZIP file and put its folder into your "custom" folder inside the "tf" folder.

```bash
/home/deck/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/custom
```

To show the ".local" folder, go into the options panel (<img height="12" width="12" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Hamburger_icon.svg">) and then enable *Show Hidden Files*.

If you dont have a "custom" folder, make one.
